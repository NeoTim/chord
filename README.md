# Weave: Scripting Cross-Device Interactions

Weave is a framework for developers to create cross-device wearable interaction by scripting. This directory contains the implementation for the Weave framework and a viewer for a set of interactive emulators.

## Goals

Weave provides a set of high-level APIs, based on JavaScript, for developers to easily distribute UI output and combine user input and sensing events across devices. These high-level APIs as well as their underlying scripting concepts allow developers to focus on their target interaction behaviors and think about target devices regarding their capabilities and affordances, rather than low-level specifications.

Weave also contributes an environment for developers to test cross-device behaviors, and when ready, deploy these behaviors to its runtime environment on usersâ€™ ad-hoc network of mobile and wearable devices.

## Requirements and Setup

This is a Chrome packaged app running JavaScript. Please install Chrome and load the directory /viewer via the Chrome Developer Tool.
